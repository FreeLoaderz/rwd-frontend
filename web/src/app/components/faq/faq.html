                <p>
                    Once you connect your wallet you will be presented with the tokens that are available to claim. The distribution mechanics depend on the issuer of that token so if something doesn't seem right please reach out to the project for more information

                <p>
                    The need for collateral was introduced with the addition of smart contracts on Cardano. Setting the collateral in your wallet helps ensure that the transaction will be validated properly. Right now, most wallets reccomend you set the collateral to
                    5 $ADA but with the Vasil hard fork a more deterministic method will be implemented to match the exact amount needed.
